What did you learn during this project?

    We learned how to work and collaborate with others on a collective
    project (communication, style). We also learned about basic game-theory
    algorithms like minimax and basic board game structure. This project
    was definitely a good stepping stone towards a more in depth projects.
    
What did you enjoy during this project?

    We enjoyed collaborating with others more closely as working with others
    is something that we have to be very careful about and seeing how what we learned
    through the quarter can be used to do more than just solve homework problems.

What did you find challenging or frustrating during this project?

    We found it challenging to understand through the algorithm of minimax throughout the project.
    Also, it was frustrating working with ed because we were more familiar with using other 
    IDEs.
    
What did you find particularly helpful for your learning during this project?

    We found it particularly helpful talking through with each member of the team and sharing/linking
    good resources we found. There was also a lot of information on youtube and stackoverflow. We Also
    found reading the APIs useful.
